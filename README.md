# Automation Analytics Front End

Automation Analytics provides data analytics for Ansible Tower that provides visualization and insight into how automation is used in your organization.

## Getting Started

## Build Automation Analytics Front End

1. ```npm install```

2. ```npm run start```
    - starts webpack bundler and serves the files with webpack dev server

### Testing

- `npm run verify` will run linters and tests
- Travis is used to test the build for this code.
  - You are always notified on failed builds
  - You are only notified on successful builds if the build before it failed
  - By default, both `push` events as well as `pull_request` events send notifications
  - Travis is defaulted to notify #insights-bots

## Deploying

- The Platform team is using Travis to deploy the application
  - The Platform team will help you set up the Travis instance if this is the route you are wanting to take

### How it works

- any push to the `{REPO}` `master` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `ci-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `ci-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `ci-stable` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `qa-beta` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `qa-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `qa-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `qa-stable` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `prod-beta` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `prod-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `prod-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `prod-stable` branch
- Pull requests (based on master) will not be pushed to `{REPO}-build` `master` branch
  - If the PR is accepted and merged, master will be rebuilt and will deploy to `{REPO}-build` `ci-beta` branch

## Running locally
Have [insights-proxy](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy) installed under PROXY_PATH

```shell
SPANDX_CONFIG="./config/spandx.config.js" bash $PROXY_PATH/scripts/run.sh
```

### Testing - jest

When you want to test your code with unit tests please use `jest` which is preconfigured in a way to colect codecoverage as well. If you want to see your coverage on server the travis config has been set in a way that it will send data to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) the only thing you have to do is visit their website (register), enable your repository and add CODECOV_TOKEN to your travis web config (do not add it to .travis file, but trough [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/))


### Building for the full stack dev env

This will build the front end for use in the full stack development environment. 

```make build```
